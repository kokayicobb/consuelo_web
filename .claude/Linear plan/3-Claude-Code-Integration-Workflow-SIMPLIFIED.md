# Claude Code Integration Workflow - SIMPLIFIED

## What Claude Code Actually Is

Claude Code is **you talking to me (Claude) through a terminal interface** - that's it. No complex automation needed.

**Think of it like this:**
- Linear = Your task management
- Claude Code = Your AI assistant that helps you complete those tasks
- GitHub (optional) = Where you store the finished work

---

## How It Actually Works

### Simple Daily Workflow

1. **Morning**: Check Linear for your assigned tasks
2. **For each task**: Open Claude Code and ask me to help
3. **I create the content**: Blog posts, email sequences, proposals, etc.
4. **You review/edit**: Add your expertise and brand voice
5. **Mark complete in Linear**: Move task to "Done"

That's it. No complex automation required.

## Optional GitHub Integration (If You Want Version Control)

**Why you might want GitHub**:
- Keep history of all content/sequences
- Share templates across team
- Version control for proposals
- Backup of all marketing materials

**Simple setup**:
1. Create repo: `consuelo_web_marketing`
2. Folders:
   ```
   marketing/
   ├── blog-posts/
   ├── email-sequences/
   ├── outbound-templates/
   ├── partnerships/
   └── social-media/
   ```
3. When you finish a task, save files there
4. Team can access and reuse materials

**But this is 100% optional** - you can just save files locally or in Google Drive.
