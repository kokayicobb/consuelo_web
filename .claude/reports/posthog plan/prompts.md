You're absolutely right! Let me give you the 5 ready-to-use prompts right here:

  ðŸš€ 5 Parallel PostHog Implementation Prompts

  PROMPT 1: Conversion Funnel Tracking

  I need to track our complete conversion funnel for launch optimization. This is CRITICAL for getting first paying customers. Please implement:

  LANDING PAGE CONVERSION TRACKING (src/app/page.tsx):
  - 'landing_page_viewed' - track traffic source, referrer, utm params
  - 'hero_cta_engaged' - when user interacts with main CTA
  - 'pricing_section_viewed' - scroll tracking to pricing
  - 'feature_demo_played' - video/demo engagement
  - 'social_proof_viewed' - when testimonials/logos section visible

  SIGNUP CONVERSION (Clerk integration):
  - 'signup_button_clicked' - from which section (hero, pricing, etc)
  - 'signup_form_started' - user began signup process
  - 'signup_completed' - successful account creation
  - 'signup_abandoned' - user left signup flow

  TRIAL/DEMO CONVERSION (roleplay flow):
  - 'demo_accessed' - user reached roleplay page
  - 'scenario_selection_started' - engaged with demo
  - 'first_session_completed' - completed first roleplay
  - 'value_demonstrated' - user experienced core value

  Key files to modify:
  - src/app/page.tsx
  - src/app/layout.tsx (Clerk integration)
  - src/app/(site)/roleplay/page.tsx

  Focus on tracking WHERE users drop off in the funnel. Include user properties like traffic_source, landing_page_variant, signup_method.

  PROMPT 2: Revenue & Payment Optimization

  I need complete revenue tracking to optimize our path to first paying customers. Please implement:

  PAYMENT INTENT TRACKING:
  - 'add_credits_clicked' - which context triggered payment (low balance, onboarding, etc)
  - 'payment_method_selected' - user payment preferences
  - 'payment_amount_selected' - track popular credit amounts
  - 'payment_form_started' - user began payment process
  - 'payment_completed' - successful purchase with revenue data
  - 'payment_failed' - track failure reasons for optimization

  PRICING PSYCHOLOGY:
  - 'pricing_table_viewed' - how long users spend on pricing
  - 'price_comparison_made' - A/B test different pricing displays
  - 'value_proposition_engagement' - which benefits resonate

  REVENUE COHORTS & LTV:
  - Track user journey from signup â†’ trial â†’ first payment
  - 'customer_acquired' - first payment milestone  
  - 'revenue_generated' with customer_lifetime_value estimates

  Key files:
  - src/components/roleplay/PaymentModal.tsx
  - src/components/roleplay/CreditsDisplay.tsx
  - src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts
  - src/components/Pricing/ (if exists)

  This directly impacts getting your first paying customers. Track every step of the money flow.

  PROMPT 3: Product-Market Fit Signals

  I need to track product-market fit indicators and user engagement quality for launch insights. Please implement:

  PRODUCT ENGAGEMENT DEPTH:
  - 'feature_discovery' - which features users try first
  - 'session_quality_score' - duration, interactions, completion rates
  - 'repeat_usage' - users coming back for multiple sessions
  - 'power_user_behavior' - users exceeding usage expectations

  VALUE REALIZATION TRACKING:
  - 'aha_moment' - when users get value (successful roleplay completion)
  - 'feedback_positive' - users requesting/receiving good feedback
  - 'skill_improvement' - measurable progress indicators
  - 'referral_intent' - sharing, recommending behaviors

  RETENTION & CHURN SIGNALS:
  - 'user_returned' - within 24h, 7d, 30d windows
  - 'session_depth_increased' - longer/better sessions over time
  - 'feature_adoption' - expanding usage patterns
  - 'churn_risk' - indicators user might not convert/retain

  Key files:
  - src/app/(site)/roleplay/page.tsx (main product experience)
  - All roleplay components in src/components/roleplay/
  - Any feedback/rating components

  Focus on leading indicators that predict payment conversion and long-term value.

  PROMPT 4: User Identity & Segmentation

  I need proper user identification and segmentation to understand who converts and who doesn't. Please implement:

  USER IDENTIFICATION (Clerk + PostHog):
  - Identify users immediately on signup with Clerk ID
  - Set user properties: signup_date, traffic_source, first_action
  - Track user progression through onboarding stages

  BEHAVIORAL SEGMENTATION:
  - 'user_type_identified' - segment by usage patterns (power_user, casual, evaluator)
  - 'conversion_likelihood' - score based on engagement patterns  
  - 'feature_preference' - voice vs text, scenario preferences
  - 'support_needs' - users who need help vs self-serve

  ACQUISITION CHANNEL TRACKING:
  - UTM parameter capture and attribution
  - Referrer analysis and source quality
  - Landing page variant effectiveness
  - Social/organic vs paid traffic conversion rates

  Key files:
  - Create: src/hooks/usePostHogIdentify.ts
  - Update: src/app/layout.tsx
  - Update: src/app/providers.tsx
  - Update: src/app/(site)/roleplay/page.tsx

  This helps you understand WHO your ideal customers are and how they behave differently.

  PROMPT 5: Real-Time Launch Dashboard

  I need a real-time dashboard to monitor launch metrics and make quick optimization decisions. Please create:

  LAUNCH METRICS DASHBOARD:
  - Daily signups, conversions, revenue (live updates)
  - Funnel conversion rates at each step
  - Popular features, drop-off points, user paths
  - Revenue per user, customer acquisition cost estimates

  A/B TEST FRAMEWORK:
  - Landing page headline/CTA variations
  - Pricing display experiments
  - Onboarding flow optimizations
  - Feature introduction sequences

  AUTOMATED ALERTS:
  - Conversion rate drops below threshold
  - Payment failures spike
  - Unusual user behavior patterns
  - Traffic source performance changes

  BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE:
  - Which traffic sources convert best
  - What user behaviors predict payment
  - Optimal pricing strategies based on data
  - Feature usage correlating with retention

  Key files:
  - Create: src/components/analytics/LaunchDashboard.tsx
  - Create: src/lib/analytics/launch-metrics.ts
  - Update: src/app/providers.tsx with enhanced tracking
  - Create: src/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx (if you want internal dashboard)

  Focus on actionable insights that help you optimize for more paying customers immediately.

  ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These:

  1. Copy each prompt into separate Claude Code conversations
  2. Run them in parallel for maximum speed
  3. Start with Prompts 1 & 2 (conversion + revenue) for immediate impact
  4. Deploy Prompts 3 & 4 next (engagement + segmentation)
  5. Finish with Prompt 5 (dashboard) to see your results

  Each prompt will create the tracking you need to optimize for your first paying customers! ðŸš€
