# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Stories component currently has a horizontal scroll feature that presents multiple story cards. However, users are experiencing several critical UX issues: the scroll animation is choppy and feels unresponsive, the scroll speed is too slow causing users to think the screen is broken, and on smaller screens the scroll doesn't reach the final "View All Stories" card, preventing users from accessing the full experience. This feature aims to fix these scroll issues to provide a smooth, responsive, and complete scrolling experience across all screen sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smooth Scroll Animation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the horizontal scroll to feel smooth and responsive, so that I can naturally browse through the stories without feeling like the interface is broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls through the Stories section THEN the horizontal card movement SHALL be smooth without choppy or jerky motion
2. WHEN the user scrolls at different speeds THEN the card animation SHALL respond proportionally and feel natural
3. WHEN the user scrolls on any device THEN the scroll SHALL feel fluid and not lag behind the user's scroll input

### Requirement 2: Appropriate Scroll Speed

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scroll to move at a reasonable speed, so that I don't think the screen is frozen or broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user begins scrolling THEN the cards SHALL start moving immediately with noticeable displacement
2. WHEN the user scrolls a moderate amount THEN the cards SHALL translate a proportional distance that feels responsive
3. WHEN the user scrolls through the entire section THEN the scroll SHALL complete in a reasonable timeframe without feeling sluggish

### Requirement 3: Complete Scroll Range on All Screens

**User Story:** As a user on any screen size, I want to be able to scroll all the way to the "View All Stories" card, so that I can access the complete stories collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls to the end on a mobile device THEN the "View All Stories" card SHALL be fully visible and centered
2. WHEN the user scrolls to the end on a tablet device THEN the "View All Stories" card SHALL be fully visible and centered
3. WHEN the user scrolls to the end on a desktop device THEN the "View All Stories" card SHALL be fully visible and centered
4. WHEN the user reaches the end of the scroll THEN there SHALL be adequate spacing after the last card to ensure full visibility

### Requirement 4: Responsive Scroll Behavior

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the scroll behavior to be optimized for my screen size, so that the experience feels native to my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on a mobile device (< 768px) THEN the scroll distance and speed SHALL be optimized for touch scrolling
2. WHEN the user is on a tablet device (768px - 1024px) THEN the scroll distance and speed SHALL be optimized for the medium screen size
3. WHEN the user is on a desktop device (> 1024px) THEN the scroll distance and speed SHALL be optimized for mouse wheel scrolling
4. WHEN the screen is resized THEN the scroll behavior SHALL adapt dynamically without requiring a page refresh
