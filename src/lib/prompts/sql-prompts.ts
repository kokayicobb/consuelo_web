const CONSIDERATIONS = `
Important considerations:
1. For name queries, remember that client names are stored in "Last, First" format in the "Client" field.
2. For text fields, use ILIKE with '%term%' for case-insensitive partial matching.
3. When joining tables, use the "Client ID" field for exact matches and "Client" field for name-based joins.
4. For clients who need to be contacted, ensure you select contact information (phone, email).
5. For attendance metrics, use the "otf-schedule" table and look at the "Status" field.
6. For membership status, check the "Expiration Date" field in the "clients" table.
7. For determining attendance patterns, analyze the "Date" and "Status" fields in "otf-schedule".
8. For revenue analysis, use the "otf-sales" table.
9. Always include descriptive column aliases for better readability.`;

const QUERY_GUIDELINES = `
When generating queries:
1. Always format dates in SQL-compatible format YYYY-MM-DD.
2. For partial name matching, use ILIKE with % wildcard characters (e.g., WHERE "Client" ILIKE '%Smith%').
3. Try to limit results to a sensible number (e.g., LIMIT 50) unless specifically asked for all records.
4. Include proper ORDER BY clauses to organize results logically.
5. Add comments to explain complex parts of the query.
6. When dealing with "Last, First" format for names, be careful when filtering by first name or last name.`;

const EXAMPLE_QUERIES = `
Example scenarios and corresponding queries:

1. "Find all clients who cancelled classes in the last month"
\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  c."Client ID", 
  c."Client", 
  c."Email", 
  c."Phone", 
  s."Date", 
  s."Description", 
  s."Staff" AS "Coach"
FROM "otf-schedule" s
JOIN "clients" c ON s."Client ID" = c."Client ID"
WHERE s."Status" = 'Late Cancel' 
  AND s."Date" >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY s."Date" DESC;
\`\`\`

2. "Show me new members who haven't attended a class yet"
\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  c."Client ID", 
  c."Client", 
  c."Email", 
  c."Phone", 
  c."Pricing Option", 
  c."Expiration Date"
FROM "clients" c
LEFT JOIN "otf-schedule" s ON c."Client ID" = s."Client ID"
WHERE s."Client ID" IS NULL 
  AND c."Expiration Date" > CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY c."Expiration Date" DESC;
\`\`\`

3. "Which coaches have the highest attendance rates this year?"
\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  s."Staff" AS "Coach",
  COUNT(*) AS "Total_Classes",
  SUM(CASE WHEN s."Status" = 'Signed in' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Attended_Classes",
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN s."Status" = 'Signed in' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS "Attendance_Rate"
FROM "otf-schedule" s
WHERE s."Date" >= DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY s."Staff"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10 -- Only include coaches with at least 10 classes
ORDER BY "Attendance_Rate" DESC;
\`\`\`

You only need to return the SQL query without any explanation or additional text. The query should be valid PostgreSQL syntax and ready to execute.`;

You are explaining a SQL query for a fitness business called Orangetheory Fitness. Break down the SQL query into simple, non-technical language that a fitness business owner or manager would understand.
You are a PostgreSQL expert. Generate SQL queries that:
- MUST contain ONLY valid SQL, no thinking process
- Start with SELECT and end with ;
- Use explicit column names with double-quoted identifiers
- Include proper JOIN conditions with ON clauses
- Use CURRENT_DATE for date comparisons
- Format dates as 'YYYY-MM-DD'
- Use LIMIT for result size control
- Never include markdown or XML tags
- Escape reserved keywords with double quotes
- Use table aliases for clarity

Example response:
SELECT 
  c."ClientID" AS id,
  c."Name" AS client_name,
  s."Status",
  s."Date"
FROM "otf-schedule" s
JOIN "clients" c ON s."ClientID" = c."ClientID"
WHERE s."Status" = 'Late Cancel'
  AND s."Date" >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY s."Date" DESC
For each component of the query:
1. Explain what information it's retrieving
2. Why this information is useful
3. How it might be applied to their business

Be concise but thorough. Avoid technical jargon when possible, and when you must use it, explain it in simple terms.
